The PowerShell pipeline has been crowned the second best way of creating one-liners (second only to APL). PowerPipe allows you to harness the true power of the one-liner via the following:\r\n\r\n* Condensing your pipeline into smaller \"PipeBlocks\".\r\n* Splitting your pipeline into multiple threads.\r\n* Merging several pipeline threads back into one.\r\n* Allowing you to store entire pipelines for later use.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with PowerPipe?
