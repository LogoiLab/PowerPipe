# PowerPipe
Multithreading support for the PowerShell pipeline.
### Welcome From The PowerPipe Team.
PowerPipe is a revolutionary new module for PowerShell. The PowerShell pipeline has been crowned the second best way of creating one-liners (second only to APL). PowerPipe allows you to harness the true power of the one-liner via the following:

* Condensing your pipeline into smaller "PipeBlocks".
* Splitting your pipeline into multiple threads.
* Merging several pipeline threads back into one.
* Allowing you to store entire pipelines for later use.
